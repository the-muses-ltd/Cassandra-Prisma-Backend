# Cassandra-Prisma-Backend
GraphQL (Prisma) Backend for the Cassandra Project. This API and BE system allows the CRUD of all resources on the Cassandra Database.

## Multiple Backends
Cassandra has multiple backend systems. An admin API that only The Muses senior members are able to access, which allows the CRUD processes to maintain and grow the database of resources that is the fuel of the Cassandra project. The second is a Read only API that allows the Cassandra Frontend to allow anyone in the world access to our database, completely free of charge.


# Cassandra Architecture
## Where does this application fit into the Cassandra Architecture?
We have multiple applications running behind the scenes to drive the Cassandra project. The webcrawlers are the first stage in the Ecosystem, where they extract the course data to be sent to the Cassandra Database.
